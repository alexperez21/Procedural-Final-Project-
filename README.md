# (ATM) Bank of Dhruva-CS4240 Procedural and Object Oriented Programming (Final Project)

### Dhruva, Alex, Anderson
*(*Dhruva in this scenario is very wealthy since he has his own bank*)*

### Description:
We are making a bank program where people can create an account to keep their money. Then, they can make deposits and withdrawals. We chose this idea because it is a fun and simple way to apply several things we learned this semester, such as object-oriented programming, the use of classes and methods, loops, and many other things.

### Requirements:
 - Create a main class which is kind of like a teller and is the interface the user uses to make all of their bank transactions.
 - Create a bank class which has all the methods for a user to influence their account
 - Create a user/account class which will be the actual object of each account


### Useful notes about project:
- The accounts **_do not_** have any money to begin with.
- Be careful to type **only** **numbers**. Do not type any extra numbers and/or characters.

### Optiional Additions
- We wanted to add transfer funtionalities
- We also wanted to add a feature where after you enter your account/password the function would recognize it and say hello first name last name. To show that the bank knows which customer it is
